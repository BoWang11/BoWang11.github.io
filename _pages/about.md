I have 8 years of experience in large-scale data analysis, statistics, physics-based modeling, and programming. In my research, I conducted model simulations of weather and air pollution, assessed model performance using observation datasets from diverse sources, and extracted actionable insights from the analysis of spatio-temporal and time-series datasets. I applied various programming languages and tools in my previous work, including Python, SQL, R, IDL, Git, Linux, High-Performance Computing, and LaTeX.

I have hands-on experience with end-to-end machine learning projects, including problem definition, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model development, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment on cloud platforms. I am familiar with data science pipelines, including data processing, data wrangling, data cleaning, and data visualization (Python libraries, Jupyter, Tableau).




<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
